#Description

For this web portfolio I really wanted to visually represent my web coder side as well as the graphic/designer side of what I have to offer. Therefore I decided to illustrate this in my main header on the home page by drawing up half my face as a vector image to showcase my designer side and the other half of my face was to stay as the original photograph with some code in the background to showcase my developer side. Throughout my website I stuck with my five colour pallette.I really tried to treat this website as a representation of myself by including valuable information of what skills I have to offer as well as an inside to who I am as a person with some of my hobbies. I provide a link to my resume so viewers have the option to see an overview of my work history. In my portfolio section I highlighted my work by showcasing my best work. The result of my site should be professional but also visually appealing and show my fun personality. 

#Challenges

A challenge I faced was using bootstrap along with my own custom CSS. I wasn't sure how my own CSS would work with the classes Bootstrap had to offer. Bootstrap is still new to me so using it and my own CSS was a huge learning experience.

Another challenge I faced was sometimes not understanding the parent to child relationship between my elements. Some of my styles wouldn't show up because they were placed with the wrong parent element. 

#Solution

To help with the challenged I faced I watched many videos that others had posted to guide me through some of the tips and tricks I needed to implement into my code. I also did some reading on bootstrap to try to familiarize myself with it. 

When some things didn't work out no matter the videos or research I did I got help from my professor.

Using these methods I was able to overcome the challenges I faced.
